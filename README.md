## Portifolio

## Description

Simple Personal portifolio build using Vanilla CSS and HTML only.

It lay foundation to build on when adding dynamic functionalities as part of continous improvement.

## Limitations

As it is,this was an academic task to implement knowledge learnt on HTML and CSS only. Additional features and functional will sparingly affect the structural framework laid.
