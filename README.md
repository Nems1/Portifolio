# Portfolio

# Description

Simple Personal portfolio build using Vanilla CSS and HTML only.

It lays a foundation to build on when adding dynamic functionalities as part of continuous learning and practice.

# Limitations

As it is,this is an academic task meant to demonstrate application of HTML and CSS knowledge covered so far. Additional features and functional will sparingly affect the structural framework laid.

The website is not perfect and it's still under improvement.It is fairly responsive.
